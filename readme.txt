- A new admin-login.html page for login
- Backend logic in server.js to validate credentials
- A redirect to admin.html upon successful login
- Session-based access control (simple token-based for now)

Why separate?
- ✅ Security: Keeping login logic separate prevents unauthorized users from loading sensitive admin UI elements before authentication.
- ✅ Clarity: admin-login.html handles authentication; admin.html handles admin functionality. Each page has a single, focused purpose.
- ✅ Performance: You avoid loading admin scripts, data, and UI for users who haven’t logged in yet.
- ✅ Scalability: Easier to add features like password recovery, multi-factor auth, or login analytics without cluttering the admin dashboard.


- 📅 Date of cancellation
- 🙍‍♂️ User info (name, title, username)
- 🙏 Slot type (opening/closing)
